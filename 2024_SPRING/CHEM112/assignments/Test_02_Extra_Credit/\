\section*{Notice of ADA Accommodation and Methods}
I have an ADA accommodation to do my assignment on paper.
This document is a utilization of that accommodation.
This assignment will utilize questions from the textbook,
\textit{Chemistry: Atoms First, 2e}, to practice the skills
and learning objectives for this class.




\section*{5. Calculate the velocity of electrons with de Broglie wavelengths of 285 nm.
(de Broglie equation: $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$)}

The equation 
\[
	\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}
\]
is accurate for non-relativistic velocities.
For relativistic velocities, the equation 
\[
	\frac{1}{\lambda_B} = \frac{mv}{h \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
\]
is more accurate.
I will determine the velocity of electrons with de Broglie wavelengths of 285 nm 
using both of these equations.


\subsection*{Calculating the de Broglie Wavelength with the Non-Relativistic Equation}
For the non-relativistic equation, we will first consider that the mass of an electron
is given to be 9.1094 x 10$^{-31}$ kg.
The non-relativistic equation:
\[
	\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}
\]
can be rewritten:
\[
	h = mv\lambda.
\]
To determine the velocity, we can rearrange the equation to give the velocity:
\[
	v = \frac{h}{m\lambda}.
\]
Substituting the variables with known values, with the knowledge that
$\qty{1}{\joule} = \qty{1}{\kilo\gram\square\metre\per\square\second}$,
gives:
\[
	v = \frac
	{\qty[mode=text]{6.63e-34}{\kilo\gram\square\metre\per\square\second\second}}
	{\qty[mode=text]{9.1094e-31}{\kilo\gram}\times\qty[mode=text]{2.85e-7}{\metre}}.
\]
This gives:
\[
	v \unit{\metre\per\second} = \frac
	{\qty[mode=text]{6.63e-34}{\kilo\gram\square\metre\per\second}}
	{\qty[mode=text]{2.596179e-37}{\kilo\gram\metre}}
\]
which provides the value:
\[
	v = \qty{2.553753035e3}{\metre\per\second} = \qty{2.553e3}{\metre\per\second}
\]
This value is closest to multiple choice option 
\textbf{D: \qty[mode=text]{2.552e3}{\metre\per\second}}.

\subsection*{Calculating the de Broglie wavelength using the Proper Relativistic Equation}
The de Broglie wavelength of a particle is a wavelength that determines the probability
density of the particle being found at a specific point $q$ in its configuration space.
This is important in quantum mechanics. 
In the context of General Chemistry I, the de Broglie wavelength is defined in our 
textbook only as a characteristic of particles and other bodies.
The relativistic definition of the de Broglie wavelength is:
\[
	\lambda_B = \frac{h}{p},
\]
where $\lambda_B$ represents the de Broglie wavelength of the particle,
$h$ represents the Planck constant,
which has the value \SI{6.62607015e-34}{\joule\second},
and $p$ represents the relativistic momentum of the particle, defined as
\[
	p = \frac{mv}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}},
\]
with $m$ representing the mass of the particle,
$v$ representing the particle's velocity, 
and $c$ representing the speed of light in a vacuum.
The invariant mass of the electron is approximately
$\SI{9.1093837015 \pm 0.0000000028 e-31}{\kilo\gram}$
according to the NIST\@.
The speed of light in a vacuum is defined as 
$\SI{299792458}{\metre\per\second}$.

Combining these equations gives the formula:
\[
	\lambda_B = \frac
	{h}
	{\frac{mv}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}
\]
which simplifies to
\[
	\lambda_B = \frac
	{h\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
	{mv}.
\]
This can be rearranged to 
\[
	\lambda_B m v = h \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}.
\]
The following steps will solve the equation for velocity:
\[
	\frac{\lambda_B m v}{h} = \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]
\[
	{(\frac{\lambda_B m v}{h})}^{2} = 
	{(\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}})}^{2}
\]
\\
\[
	\frac{\lambda_B^{2}m^{2}v^{2}}{h^{2}} = 1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}
\]
\\
\[
	1 = \frac{\lambda_B^2 m^2 v^2}{h^2} + \frac{v^2}{c^2}	
\]
\\
\[
	1 = \frac{\lambda_B^2 m^2 v^2 c^2 + v^2 h^2}{h^2 c^2}
\]
