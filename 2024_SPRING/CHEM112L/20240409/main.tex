\section*{Notice of ADA Accommodation}
I have an ADA accommodation to type out my pre-lab report when my disability flares up.
This document is a utilization of that accommodation.

\section{Question One}
\begin{quote}
    What is the point of this lab? Define the chemical principles we are testing in your own words.
\end{quote}






\section{Question Two}
\begin{quote}
    What is the logic of this lab? How do the procedures test the hypothesis that the chemical 
    processes are correct?
\end{quote}






\section{Question Three}
\begin{quote}
    Where are potential problem points in the procedures? Where is it easy to make an error 
    or have something just go wrong?
\end{quote}






\section{Question Four}
\begin{quote}
    What are the health and safety hazards for this lab and how do we minimize them?
\end{quote}
