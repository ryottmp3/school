\section*{In medias reas: Drive back after she died}
I lay limp on the back seat of my friend's truck,
speeding down the highway at 75 miles an hour.
My face is hot and wet with tears as I try to process what just happened.
My sister is dead.
Gone.
I will never see her again, and somehow I have to accept that.
I sit up and stare out the front windshield watching the lines on the road whisk by
and try to forget my pain, try to push it down so it can't hurt me.
As warm tears stream down my face, I realize that would be a fruitless
endeavor:
I needed to face this head on and let myself feel my feelings.
I collapse back into a heap on the seat, unable to control my bawling.
In that moment, I knew my life would never be the same.
