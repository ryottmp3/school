\section{Find the Taylor Series for $f(x) = \cos{(x)}$ centered at $a=0$.
	For what $x$-values does the series converge?}

The Taylor series for $f(x)$, centered at $a$ can be defined as: 

\begin{equation}
	\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} {(x-a)}^{n}\,.	
\end{equation}

Taking $f(x)$ to be defined as $\cos{(x)}$ and $a = 0$ gives us the first few terms

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\cos{(0)}{{(x-0)}^{0}}}{0!} +
	\frac{-\sin{(0)}{(x-0)}^{1}}{1!} +
	\frac{-\cos{(0)}{(x-0)}^{2}}{2!} +
	\frac{\sin{(0)}{(x-0)}^{3}}{3!} + \cdots \,,
\end{equation}
which can be simplified to
\begin{equation}
	1 + \frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \frac{x^{4}}{4!} + \cdots \,.
\end{equation}
This can be generalized in series notation as
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} \,.
\end{equation}

To determine the interval of convergence for this series, we must use
a convergence test.
Since a factorial is involved, we will use the ratio test for convergence.

We define $a_n$ as $\frac{x^{2n}}{{(2n)}!}$\,, and $a_{n+1}$ as
$\frac{x^{2{(n+1)}}}{{(2{(n+1)})}!}$\,.
Thus, by the definition of the ratio test, we find
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\textup{L} &=
	\lim_{n\to\infty}
	\left|
	\frac
	{\frac{x^{2n+2}}{{(2n+2)}!}}
	{\frac{x^{2n}}{{(2n)}!}}
	\right|\\
	  &= \lim_{n\to\infty}
	\left|
	\frac
	{x^{2n+2}\cdot{(2n)}!}
	{x^{2n}\cdot{(2n+2)}!}
	\right|\\
	  &=
	   \lim_{n\to\infty}
	   \left|
	   \frac
	   {x^{2}}
	   {{(2n+1)}{(2n+2)}}
	   \right|\\
	  &=
	  \lim_{n\to\infty}
	  \left|
	  \frac{x^2}{2{(n+1)}{(2n+1)}}
	  \right|
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
In this limit, the $x$-values, while variable,
do not necessarily increase with $n$ and can be treated as an arbitrary
constant of sorts.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	L &= 
	\lim_{n\to\infty}
	\left|
	\frac{x^2}{4n^2+6n+2}
	\right|\to0\\
	  &= 0
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Because of this, it follows that $a_n$ converges absolutely,
for all values of $x$.
In other words, $x$ converges on the interval ${(-\infty,\infty)}$.

\section{Give the 4th-order Taylor Polynomial, $p_{4}{(x)}$, for 
$f{(x)}=\cos{(x)}$, centered at $a=0$}

The Taylor Polynomial can be derived from the Taylor Series as such:
\begin{equation}
	p_{k}{(x)} = \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{f^{(n)}{(a)}}{n!}{(x-a)}^{n} \,.
\end{equation}
This allows us to find the fourth Taylor polynomial for the provided function
$f{(x)}=\cos{(x)}$:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		p_{0}{(x)} &= 1\\
		p_{1}{(x)} &= 1 - 0x\\
		p_{2}{(x)} &= 1 - 0x + \frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\
		p_{3}{(x)} &= 1 - 0x + \frac{1}{2}x^{2} - 0x^{3}\\
		p_{4}{(x)} &= 1 - 0x + \frac{1}{2}x^{2} - 0x^{3} + \frac{1}{24}x^{4}\\
		\leadsto p_{4}{(x)} &= 1 + \frac{1}{2}x^{2} + \frac{1}{24}x^{4}\,.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
